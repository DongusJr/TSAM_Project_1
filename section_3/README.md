# Project 1 TSAM
In this folder you can find a simple server and client.

### Compiling
To compile the files you can run in the terminal and make sure you are positioned in the same folder as this README file.
> make

If you wish to only compile the server you can run
> make server

or if you wish to compile only the client you can run
> make client

### Running the server
To run the server you must type into the terminal:
> ./server \<ip port\>

And to run the client you must type into the terminal:
> ./client \<ip address\> \<ip port\>

### Client
While running the client, you can run bash commands which must be preceeded by "SYS".

I recommend trying out the following:
* > SYS ls -al
* > SYS cat server.cpp
